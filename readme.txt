Statistical_Models_Central_Limit_Theorem
=========================================
Write an R-script that transforms the data to sum across all zip codes in the Chicago Diabetes Hospital Data Set. Make a model that plots and fits a line to the following:
Number of Hospitalizations vs. Crude Admittance Rate.
Change in Number of Hospitalizations vs. Change in Crude Admittance Rate
Be sure to interpret the slopes for each model (Some good examples here: http://www.austincc.edu/mparker/1342/lessons/less5-8/interpret_slope.pdf)
Comment on the differences in R^2 between the two- what does this mean
